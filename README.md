# NotEnoghTweaks
It's a higly customizable Spigot plugin, which simplifes players' casual tasks: from mining to farming. Localizable and dupe-protected

So, this plugin adds some tweaks at your server. It still don't support permission system, but if it'll required, i'll add it.
## Tweaks list:
 ### Coloring blocks
 ### Crops harvesting
 ### Blocks autochange
 ### Tools autochange
 ### Blocks' amount display (still don't support locales)

Every tweak have a tip, which suggest players to use them.
Also, administrators can configure the list of operative tweaks.
So, if you find some tweak unfair or just useless you can easily turn it off
NotEnoughTweaks supprots WorldGuard - players can't modify the world using tweaks if they don't have access to the region

Last tested version: 1.11.2, Spigot
Softly depend on WorldGuard
